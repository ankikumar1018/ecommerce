ShopSphere — Expanded PRD

(Expanded 4–6 page PRD would include: background, product/technical goals, detailed use cases, API contracts, authentication flows, data model, scaling considerations, monitoring, deployment plan, milestones and risk analysis.)

Refer to `PRD_Interview_Readme.md` for the condensed version. This file is a placeholder for the full expanded PRD; if you'd like I will generate the expanded document with full tables, API contract examples, and decision logs.
